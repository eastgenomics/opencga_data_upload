<!--
TODO: Please edit this Readme.developer.md file to include information
for developers or advanced users, for example:

## Dependencies
The `requiremens.txt` file was automatically generated during the development of the applet using `pip freeze` command.
One of the first steps of this applet is to prepare the environment for running. The python virtual environment is activated and all the requirements from the file are installed (if there weren't already present in the environment).

## Running this app with additional computational resources [autogenerated]

This app has the following entry points:

* main

When running this app, you can override the instance type to be used by
providing the ``systemRequirements`` field to ```/applet-XXXX/run``` or
```/app-XXXX/run```, as follows:

    {
      systemRequirements: {
        "main": {"instanceType": "mem2_hdd2_x2"}
      },
      [...]
    }

See <a
href="https://documentation.dnanexus.com/developer/api/running-analyses/io-and-run-specifications#run-specification">Run
Specification</a> in the API documentation for more information about the
available instance types.
